He knows that some of you may be ill; and others traveling through the land, seeking Allah’s bounty; and others fighting in Allah’s way. So read of it what is easy for you, and perform the prayer, and give the purifying charity, and lend Allah a loan of goodness. Whatever good you advance for yourselves, you will find it with Allah, improved and greater in reward. And ask Allah for forgiveness—Allah is Forgiving and Merciful."
